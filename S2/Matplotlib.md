1. What is Matplotlib?
- Matplotlib is one of the most widely used data visualization libraries in Python. It is mainly designed for creating 2D plots, but it also supports limited 3D plotting. Its interface is similar to MATLAB, which is why itâ€™s called Mat-plotlib.The most common way to use it is via the `pyplot` module, which provides a MATLAB-like interface.
- Key Features:
- - Comprehensive: Supports line plots, scatter plots, bar charts, histograms, pie charts, error bars, heatmaps, and more.
- - Highly customizable: Almost every element (axes, titles, labels, colors, line styles, fonts, etc.) can be adjusted.
- - Compatible: Works well with NumPy, Pandas, and SciPy, making it ideal for data analysis and scientific research.
